# Randolio: Meth Van

A way to cook up meth in a Journey van (skill minigame based). Requires you to be in seat 1 (back left). Supports both ox lib radial and qb-radialmenu and uses a statebag for the particle fx.

**NOTE**: I just used ingredients and stuff which I already had in my server. You'll need to adjust the items/amounts in the sv_meth.lua if you want. Do not ask me for support.

## Requirements

* [ox_lib](https://github.com/overextended/ox_lib/releases/tag/v3.16.2)
